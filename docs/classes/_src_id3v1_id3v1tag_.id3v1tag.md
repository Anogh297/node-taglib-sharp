## Accessors

### album

• get **album**(): string

*Overrides [Tag](_src_tag_.tag.md).[album](_src_tag_.tag.md#album)*

**`inheritdoc`** 

**Returns:** string

• set **album**(`value`: string): void

*Overrides [Tag](_src_tag_.tag.md).[album](_src_tag_.tag.md#album)*

**`inheritdoc`** 

**`remarks`** When stored on disk, only the first 30 bytes of the latin-1 encoded value will
    be stored. This may result in data loss.

#### Parameters:

Gets the band or artist who is credited credited in the creation of the entire album or
collection containing the media described by the current instance.

**`remarks`** This field is typically optional but aids in the sorting of compilations or albums
    with multiple artist. For example, if an album has several artists, sorting by artist
    will split up albums by the same artist. Having a single album artist for an entire
    album solves this problem.
    As this value is to be used as a sorting key, it should be used with less variation
    than [performers](_src_id3v1_id3v1tag_.id3v1tag.md#performers). Where performers can be broken into multiple artists, it is
    best to stick to a single name. Eg, "Super8 & Tab"

Band or artist credited with the creation of the entire album or collection
    containing the media described by the current instance or an empty array if no value is
    present
